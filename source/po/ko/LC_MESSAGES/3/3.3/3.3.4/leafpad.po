"Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity, similar "
"to gedit that ships with Ubuntu. It is simple to use and starts up "
"quickly, while still containing essential features, being a decent, "
"lightweight text editor that can be used for development despite its "
"lightness."

"Leafpad allows to perform basic text operations, including unlimited "
"undo/redo and drag-and-drop. It automatically detects codeset, but you "
"can also change it manually. It can create automatic indents and display "
"line numbers, which is useful for programming. You can also print text "
"from this app."
