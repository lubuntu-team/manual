"A good example of when you would use a live session is if your computer "
"turns on and won't boot, you can run the live session. You could then "
"mount the disk and backup all of your pictures or send an email. If your "
"hard drive or SSD is no longer working, you can boot a live session and "
"then order replacement parts. You also can feel free to try different "
"things out in a live session and not worry about breaking your install. A"
" live session is also useful to see if you have misconfigured something "
"that broke it or confirm that is a problem always without configuration "
"changes."

"A live session will not save your things to disk but will not by default "
"mess up your installed system. This is not the case if you mount your "
"filesystems on your disk and write to the disk. By default the live "
