What is Lubuntu?
----------------

The project’s goal is to provide a lightweight yet functional Linux distribution based on a rock-solid Ubuntu base. Lubuntu provides a simple but modern and powerful graphical user interface, and comes with a wide variety of applications so you can browse, email, chat, play, and be productive. Lubuntu was formerly a distribution for low-end hardware, but `we have refocused <https://Lubuntu.me/taking-a-new-direction/>`_.

Members of the team take care of LXQt and other packages that are part of Lubuntu in the Ubuntu archive. 

Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the Ubuntu family beginning with Lubuntu 11.10.
