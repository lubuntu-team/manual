Chapter 2.4.3 Kcalc
===================

Kcalc is the default scientific calculator application for Lubuntu.

Features:

 - Trigonometric functions
 - Factorials
 - Built in mathematical and scientific constants.
 - Memory
 - Copy and paste

Usage
------
To do simple arithmetic click the numbers and then press the sign for addition, multiplication, subtraction,  or division. You can also type in the numbers and press :guilabel:`+` for addition, :guilabel:`-` for subtraction, :guilabel:`x` for multiplication and the division symbol for division. To view the answer press the button that is an :guilabel:`=`. To view a summary of each button you can mouse over to get a verbal description of the button.

To make a number negative press the button that looks like a :guilabel:`+/-`. To insert decimals press the decimal point button which looks like a :guilabel:`.` when you get to the part which is less than a whole number. To clear input from Kcalc Press the button with a :guilabel:`C` on it. To group operations so they happen together use the parenthesis to make things grouped together for example 2*(2+3) would give the result of 10 because it would add 2 and 3 and then multiply by two. You can also press the :guilabel:`(` or :guilabel:`)` buttons to make parathesis to change the order of operations.

To copy and answer out of Kcalc press :kbd:`control + c` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Copy` from the menu. To paste a number into Kcalc you can press :kbd:`control + v` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste` from the menu. To cut the text from Kcalc press :kbd:`control +x` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Cut` from the menu.

To undo an operation press :kbd:`Control+Z` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Undo`. To redo an operation press :kbd:`Control+Shift+Z` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Redo`. 

Scientific calculator mode advanced functionality
-------------------------------------------------

If you want even more functionality of Kcalc there is also scientific mode which is accessed from :menuselection:`Settings --> Scientific Mode` radio button. The button :guilabel:`1/x` takes takes 1 and divides it by the number currently on the calculator also known as taking the reciprocal. :guilabel:`x!` read x factorial will take the number X you entered and multiple each number going down to 1 for example 5! would multiply 5*4*3*2*1. 

The x :superscript:`2` button will take a x*x and multiply it by itself or square x. The button with x :superscript:`y` will take x the number you have in will exponentiate x to the power of y. The x 10 :superscript:`y` will end up multiplying x by 10 to the power of y so for example to multiply 5 by 10 to the power of 3 entering in will give the answer of 5,000. If you want your own custom constants buttons check the checkbox for :menuselection:`Settings --> Constants Buttons`.

To change the unit that angles are measured in for trigonometric units in Kcalc. Degrees take 360 to form a full circle while, 2Π radians form a full circle and 400 gradians form a full circle. The radio button for Deg is to select Degrees as the unit for angles, :guilabel:`Rad` selects radian as the unit of measurement of angles and :guilabel:`Grad` selects Gradians as the unit of measurement for angles. The :guilabel:`Sin` button takes what you have as the input and takes the trigonometric sine function of that value measured in the unit for angles you have selected. The :guilabel:`Cos` button takes the cosine of the value in the unit of angle you have selected. The :guilabel:`Tan` button takes the tangent of the angle in the current units.

To have a log with the base of 10 type the number you want to take the log of then press the :guilabel:`Log` button. To take a log based off e, the natural logarithm, type the number you want to take the logarithm of then press the :guilabel:`Ln` button.

The Scientific mode also brings in a menu for many different predetermined comments under the :menuselection:`Constants`.
 
To store a value in memory press the :guilabel:`M+` Button. To retrieve a value from memory press the :guilabel:`MR` button. To clear a value from memory press the :guilabel:`MC` button.

Numerical System mode
---------------------
The numerical system mode lets you change your numerical base instead of say the default base 10. To switch to a binary calculations click the :guilabel:`Bin` radio button. To switch the Octal or base 8 format click the :guilabel:`Oct` radio button. To switch to a hexadecimal format or base 16 format click the :guilabel:`Hexadecimal` radio button. For numbers greater than 10 for hexadecimal press the A-F buttons. When you are in number that are not part of a numerical base the button will get grayed out. To switch back to decimal or base 10 press the :guilabel:`Dec` radio button.

Statistic Mode
----------------
To enter Statistic mode :menuselection:`Settings --> Statistic Mode`. To enter multiple entries of data press the :guilabel:`Dat` button to enter data. To show how many pieces of data you have entered press the :guilabel:`N`. To view the mean or average of all the data press the :guilabel:`Mea` button. To view the median of the data press the :guilabel:`Med` button. To clear the statistical memory press the :guilabel:`CSt` button.

Customizing
-----------
To open configuration for Kcalc press :kbd:`Control+Shift+ +` or :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Kcalc`. To view your settings for precision or digit grouping use the :guilabel:`General` tab. To change the maximum number of digits change the :guilabel:`Maximum number of digits` field. To have Kcalc set decimal precision to only a certain number of places after the decimal place check the :guilabel:`Set decimal precision` checkbox and select the number of digits after the decimal place. If you ant to show the result in the window title check the :guilabel:`Show result in window title` checkbox. To have Kcalc group digits together check the :guilabel:`Group digits` checkbox. 

To cancel and not apply your changes press the :guilabel:`Cancel` button along the bottom. To apply your changes and not exit from this window press the :guilabel:`Apply` button. To restore the settings to your defaults press the :guilabel:`Restore Defaults` button. To apply your changes if any and close this window press the :guilabel:`OK` button.
