"To search for a program, press :kbd:`Super(windows)+R` and start typing a"
" command. The search results will show below, similar to address bar "
"behavior in browsers. All installed applications can be launched this way"
" and Runner can be configured to store a history of recent programs. If "
"you want to clear history open the downward pointing menu "
":menuselection:`Clear History`. The runner even lets you logout, "
"shutdown, or other ways to leave your session through the runner. Also "
"keep in mind you do not have to search for the start of an application "
"like inputting :kbd:`grab` will show results for ScreenGrab. To paste a "
"command to run into the runner press :kbd:`Control +V` or right click on "
"the runner and select :menuselection:`Paste`."

"Runner can also work as a calculator if you put for example :kbd:`2+2=` "
"and you will get the answer. To add numbers together with the calculator "
"enter the :kbd:`+` in the bar. To subtract numbers together with the "
"calculator enter the :kbd:`-` in the bar. To multiply numbers enter "
":kbd:`*` into the bar. To divide numbers in runner enter :kbd:`/` into "
"the bar. To exponentiate enter :kbd:`^` into the bar. To actually get the"
" result you will need to put a :kbd:`=` at the end."
