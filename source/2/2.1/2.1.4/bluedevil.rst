Shortcomings

While Bluedevil can handle most basic operations, some tasks need to be completed via the command line. Here are some common tasks:

You can list the devices that are already paired by running the following:

.. code::

  $ bt-device -l
  Added devices:
  FOO BAR (00:11:22:33:44:55)

Connect to Paired Device Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to `FOO BAR`, you would run:

.. code::

  $ bluetoothctl connect 00:11:22:33:44:55
  Attempting to connect to 00:11:22:33:44:55
