"The objective of the Lubuntu project is to create a flavor of Ubuntu that"
" is lighter, less resource hungry, and more energy-efficient by using "
"lightweight applications and LXDE, The Lightweight X11 Desktop "
"Environment, as its default GUI."

"Lubuntu is targeted at PC and laptop users running on low-spec hardware "
"that, in most cases, just doesn't have enough resources for all the bells"
" and whistles of the \"full-featured\" mainstream distributions. Members "
"of the team take care of LXDE and other packages that are part of Lubuntu"
" in the Ubuntu archive. Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal"
" member of the Ubuntu family, beginning with Lubuntu 11.10. Even though "
"Lubuntu is a lightweight distribution, it does not mean you will not be "
"able to run all applications that other distributions are currently "
"offering. It does mean that it is prepared and developed for low-"
"specification computers. Nonetheless, you can run any application "
"available in the official repositories, as long as your hardware can bear"
" with it."
