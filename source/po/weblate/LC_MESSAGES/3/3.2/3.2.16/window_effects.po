"drawing shadows on the panel. The :guilabel:`Color of shadow` lets you "
"change the color of shadows from windows. The field for :guilabel:`The "
"blur radius for shadows` changes how big to blur the shadows. "
":guilabel:`The left offset for shadows` is how far to move the shadows to"
" the left with a larger number makes the shadow appear farther to the "
"right. :guilabel:`The top offset for shadows` the larger the number "

"The :guilabel:`Opacity` tab is for transparency settings. Setting Opacity"
" to 1.00 makes it opaque while 0 makes it entirely clear. Menus, inactive"
" windows, active windows, and titlebars and borders all can have their "
"opacity changed independently. To not change how bright or dim windows "
"are with window opacity check the :guilabel:`Do not let dimness adjust "
"based on window opacity`. The :guilabel:`Blur background of transparent "
"windows` blurs the background of transparent windows. To not change how "
"far a window blurs on window transparency check the :guilabel:`Do not let"
" blur radius adjust based on window opacity`."
