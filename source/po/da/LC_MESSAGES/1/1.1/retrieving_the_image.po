"Lubuntu supports AMD64 CPU types also known as 64-bit with a new version "
"every six months (supported for nine months), and every two years being a"
" long term support release (supported for three years). If you have a 32 "
"bit processor we unfortunately had to drop support but 18.04 LTS is still"
" supported until 2021 for 32 bit. Lubuntu 20.04 is a Long Term Support "

"Lubuntu offers two types of releases. The **Long Term Support** release, "
"or the **LTS**, is the release recommended for most users. It is "
"supported for three years after the release date and does not contain new"
" features. Throughout the course of the cycle, the Ubuntu Kernel Team "
"will deliver **Hardware Enablement** updates, or **HWE** updates, to "
"Lubuntu via Linux kernel updates. Previously, Lubuntu used **LXDE** but "
"since 18.10 it has used the **LXQt**. Lubuntu 20.04 is the First **Long "
"Term Support** release which uses the more modern **LXQt** desktop "
"environment."

"For users looking to try new features every six months at the expense of "
"the support cycle length, Lubuntu offers **interim releases**, or "
"**regular releases**. These releases, while they are considered stable, "
"are testing grounds for major, new features which will be rolled into the"
" LTS release. Users of the regular releases are typically enthusiasts and"
" somewhat more experienced users looking for a fresher experience."
