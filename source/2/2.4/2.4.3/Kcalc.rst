Chapter 2.4.3 KCalc
===================

KCalc is the default scientific calculator application for Lubuntu.

Features:

 - Trigonometric functions
 - Factorials
 - Built in mathematical and scientific constants.
 - Memory
 - Copy and paste

Usage
------
To do simple arithmetic click the numbers or type them on your keyboard and then press the sign for addition, multiplication, subtraction,  or division. You can also type in the numbers and press :guilabel:`+` for addition, :guilabel:`-` for subtraction, :guilabel:`x` for multiplication and the division symbol for division. To view the answer press the button that is an :guilabel:`=`. To view a summary of each button you can mouse over to get a verbal description of the button. If you make a mistake entering in a number you can press the :kbd:`Backspace` key.

To make a number negative press the button that looks like a :guilabel:`+/-`. To insert decimals press the decimal point button which looks like a :guilabel:`.` when you get to the part which is less than a whole number. To clear input from KCalc before the last operator press the button with a :guilabel:`C` on it. To clear all input from KCalc press the :guilabel:`AC` button. To group operations so they happen together use the parenthesis to make things grouped together for example 2*(2+3) would give the result of 10 because it would add 2 and 3 and then multiply by two. You can also press the :guilabel:`(` or :guilabel:`)` buttons to make parenthesis to change the order of operations.

To undo an operation press :kbd:`Control+Z` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Undo`. To redo an operation press :kbd:`Control+Shift+Z` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Redo`. 

To copy and answer out of KCalc press :kbd:`control + c` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Copy` from the menu. To paste a number into KCalc you can press :kbd:`control + v` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste` from the menu. To cut the text from KCalc press :kbd:`control +x` or :menuselection:`Edit --> Cut` from the menu.

To view your history what you have calculated in Kcalc press :kbd:`Control+h` or :menuselection:`Settings --> Show History`. To hide your history do the same thing again. You can select text with the mouse in Kcalc and then right click select :menuselection:`Copy` or press :kbd:`Control+C` to copy what you have previously calculated.

To quit KCalc press :kbd:`Control+Q`.

Scientific calculator mode advanced functionality
-------------------------------------------------

If you want even more functionality of KCalc there is also scientific mode which is accessed from :menuselection:`Settings --> Science Mode` radio button. The button :guilabel:`1/x` takes takes 1 and divides it by the number currently on the calculator also known as taking the reciprocal. The :guilabel:`x!` button read x factorial will take the number X you entered and multiple each number going down to 1 for example 5! would multiply 5*4*3*2*1.

The x :superscript:`2` button will multiply x by itself or square x. The button with x :superscript:`y` will take x the number you have in will exponentiate x to the power of y. The x :superscript:`3` button will cube the result or raise it to the third power. The x 10 :superscript:`y` will end up multiplying x by 10 to the power of y so for example to multiply 5 by 10 to the power of 3 entering in will give the answer of 5,000.

To change the unit that angles are measured in for trigonometric units in KCalc. Degrees take 360 to form a full circle while, 2Î  radians form a full circle and 400 gradians form a full circle. The radio button :guilabel:`Deg` is to select Degrees as the unit for angles, :guilabel:`Rad` selects radian as the unit of measurement of angles and :guilabel:`Grad` selects Gradians as the unit of measurement for angles. The :guilabel:`Sin` button takes what you have as the input and takes the trigonometric sine function of that value measured in the unit for angles you have selected. The :guilabel:`Cos` button takes the cosine of the value in the unit of angle you have selected. The :guilabel:`Tan` button takes the tangent of the angle in the current units.

If you make a mistake entering a long input into KCalc press the button that looks like a leftward pointing arrow button to correct your mistake just like pressing :kbd:`Backspace`.

To have a log with the base of 10 type the number you want to take the log of then press the :guilabel:`Log` button. To take a log based off e, the natural logarithm, type the number you want to take the logarithm of then press the :guilabel:`Ln` button.

The Scientific mode also brings in a menu for many different predetermined constants under the :menuselection:`Constants`. If you want a button for  constants check the :menuselection:`Settings --> Constants Buttons` checkbox. To input the first constant press the :guilabel:`C1` button for the first constant and so on for the other constants.
 
To store a value in memory press the :guilabel:`M+` Button. To retrieve a value from memory press the :guilabel:`MR` button. To clear a value from memory press the :guilabel:`MC` button.

Numerical System mode
---------------------
 To switch the calculator into number system mode :menuselection:`Settings --> Numeral Systyem Mode`. The numerical system mode lets you change your numerical base instead of say the default base 10. To switch to a binary calculations click the :guilabel:`Bin` radio button. To switch the Octal or base 8 format click the :guilabel:`Oct` radio button. To switch to a hexadecimal format or base 16 format click the :guilabel:`Hexadecimal` radio button. For numbers greater than 10 for hexadecimal press the :guilabel:`A`-:guilabel:`F` buttons standing in for numbers 10-15 in base 10. When you are in number that are not part of a numerical base the button will get grayed out. To switch back to decimal or base 10 press the :guilabel:`Dec` radio button.

If you type a number into in your numerical base you will see the underneath the buttons will show what that number is in that numerical base.

Statistic Mode
----------------
To enter Statistic mode :menuselection:`Settings --> Statistic Mode`. To enter multiple entries of data press the :guilabel:`Dat` button to enter data. To show how many pieces of data you have entered press the :guilabel:`N`. To view the mean or average of all the data press the :guilabel:`Mea` button. To view the median of the data press the :guilabel:`Med` button. To clear the statistical memory press the :guilabel:`CSt` button.

To open configuration for KCalc press :kbd:`Control+Shift+ +` or :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure KCalc`. To view your settings for precision or digit grouping use the :guilabel:`General` tab. To change the maximum number of digits change the :guilabel:`Maximum number of digits` field. To have KCalc set decimal precision to only a certain number of places after the decimal place check the :guilabel:`Set decimal precision` checkbox and select the number of digits after the decimal place. If you ant to show the result in the window title check the :guilabel:`Show result in window title` checkbox. To have KCalc group digits together check the :guilabel:`Group digits` checkbox. 

To cancel and not apply your changes press the :guilabel:`Cancel` button along the bottom. To apply your changes and not exit from this window press the :guilabel:`Apply` button.
