"the :guilabel:`+` button. To collapse a group of mimetypes press the "
":guilabel:`-` button. Once you find the filetype you want to change on "
"the top right it tells you what kind of file that mimetype is and shows "
"the extensions. The current default is shown on the lower right with a "

"else. To change a default press the :guilabel:`Change` button and it "
"brings up a menu to choose the new default program for this kind of file."
