Chapter 2.5.2 PulseAudio Volume Control
========================================

PulseAudio Volume Control is the default volume mixer for Lubuntu. It also manages multiple input and output devices for all programs on your system.

Usage
------
The :guilabel:`Playback` tab of PulseAudio Volume Control gives you the ability to the control the output device, mute, or change the volume of each application. To change the Volume of each application on the playback slide the slider to the right for more volume or to the left for less volume. Above your volume slider the is a bar that shows how much volume is currently emitted by that particular application. The button with an X over the speaker is a mute button and if it is a darker gray that application is currently muted and can't make any sound. The drop down :guilabel:`Show` drop down menu lets you see your virtual streams and applications. In the bottom right hand corner is the current volume level viewed as a percentage. This program also in software allows you to go over 100 percent volume if it is too quiet. If you have multiple sound outputs enabled you can change what output  of an application by using the :guilabel:`on` menu.
