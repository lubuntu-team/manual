"To configure a VPN the best way to do it is with  in the Menu under "
":menuselection:`Preferences --> Advanced Network Configuration`. That "
"will open network-manager-gnome you will need also to install the "
"corresponding packages. In case of pptp those will be network-manager-"
"pptp and network-manager-pptp-gnome. The you can follow the configuration"
" instruction for each VPN type. After the creation, it will appear as a "
"new connection in nm-tray. One thing to consider is that nm-tray does not"
" support password asking, so either you save the password FOR ALL USERS "
"or you will need to connect differently. One of the  option is through "
"terminal with typing"

"If you don't want to run by terminal nm-applet you could change nm-tray "

" do this from the GUI is in the Menu going to :menuselection:`Preferences"
" --> LXQt settings --> Session Settings`. There go to the "
":guilabel:`Autostart` tab. You will see a list with checked and unchecked"
" box, to autostart nm-applet, check :guilabel:`Network` to disable "
