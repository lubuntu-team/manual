"will need to create an EFI system partition see  "
"`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition` for more detail to "
"create this partition you will need a fat32 filesystem with the ESP flag "
"with to be mounted at /boot/efi/ under the mount point. You will  also "
"need a / or root filesystem several filesystems included for Lubuntu are "

" are booting an efi system you will also need a /boot/efi mounted "
