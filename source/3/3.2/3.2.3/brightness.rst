Chapter 3.2.3 Brightness
========================

Brightness is the default tool to control your screen brightness. If you are using a laptop turning down your screen brightness can increase battery life by a large amount as well however too dim and the screen will be illegible.

Usage
------
To use brightness click drag a set of sliders on thee for a particular monitor or backlight. To make the screen dimmer use the :kbd:`left arrow` key or click on the slider and drag the dial towards the left. If you want to make the screen more bright press the :kbd:`right arrow` key or drag the slider towards the right. The name of your display(s) will be on a slider on the center. After doing this you will be asked to confirm the current brightness is OK while needing to select :guilabel:`Yes`. If you do not respond it will revert the old brightness which is useful because if you made your screen illegible it will revert to the old settings. Using a less bright backlight will result in longer battery life.
